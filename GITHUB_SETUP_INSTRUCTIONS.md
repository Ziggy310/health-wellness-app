# 🚀 GitHub + Vercel Deployment Instructions

## 📋 What You Need to Provide

### GitHub Information Required:
1. **Your GitHub Username** (e.g., `yourusername`)
2. **Preferred Repository Name** (suggestion: `health-wellness-app`)
3. **Repository Visibility** (Public or Private - your choice)

### Option A: Manual Setup (Recommended)
**Step 1:** Create New Repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `health-wellness-app` (or your preference)
- Description: "Health and wellness app with meal planning and educational resources"
- Choose Public or Private
- Don't initialize with README (we have one ready)
- Click "Create repository"

**Step 2:** Push Your Code
```bash
cd /data/chats/4gnaud/workspace/react_template
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Health wellness app"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPONAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Automated Setup (Requires Token)
If you want me to create the repository automatically:
1. **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `repo` permissions
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate new token → Select "repo" scope → Generate token
   - Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)

## 🌐 Vercel Deployment (After GitHub Setup)

1. **Go to Vercel.com** and sign in with GitHub
2. **Click "New Project"**
