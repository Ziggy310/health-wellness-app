# User Registration and Onboarding Testing Notes

## Current Behavior

1. When accessing the Meno+ application at https://meno-plus-0rqum-exn6ad-a69f4f.mgx.dev/, clicking the "Enter App" button on the landing page automatically logs in as "Test User" without requiring registration or login credentials.

2. Attempting to access /logout redirects to the splash page but clicking from there still auto-logs in as "Test User".

3. Unable to test the complete registration and onboarding flow as the system appears to have a pre-configured test account.

## Onboarding Files Found

The following files related to onboarding were found in the codebase:
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/DietaryPreferences.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/MotivationalScreen.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingDiet.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingFlowEnhanced.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingGoals.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingPreview.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingStart.jsx`
- `/data/chats/exn6ad/workspace/react_template/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingSymptoms.jsx`

These files indicate a comprehensive onboarding process is implemented in the codebase, but it cannot be accessed in the current demo environment.

## Next Steps

Since we cannot test the actual registration and onboarding flow, we will proceed with testing other aspects of the application while noting that this area could not be fully tested.
