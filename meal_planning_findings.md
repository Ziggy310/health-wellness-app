# Meal Planning Functionality Testing

## Meal Plan Overview Page

### Functionality
- The meal plan page displays a weekly meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options for each day of the week
- Users can navigate between days via horizontal scrolling
- Each meal displays a thumbnail image, title, and prep time
- Clicking on a meal takes users to a detailed view of that meal

### Issues Found
- **Meal Thumbnails:** Some meal thumbnails appear to be missing or displaying placeholders instead of actual meal images
- **Limited Customization:** No obvious way to swap meals or customize the entire meal plan at once

## Meal Detail Page

### Functionality
- Displays comprehensive information about the selected meal:
  - Meal name (e.g., "Greek Yogurt with Berries and Flaxseeds")
  - Prep time (5 min)
  - Serving size (1 serving)
  - Description
  - Key features with icons (High-protein, Calcium-rich, Anti-inflammatory)
  - Detailed timing (prep time, cook time, total time)
  - Ingredients list with quantities
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Nutrition information
  - Menopause symptom benefits (Hot flashes, Bone health, Energy levels)
- Action buttons: Save Recipe, Add to Plan, Share
- Back to Meal Plan navigation option
- Customize Meal button

### Issues Found
- **Critical: Missing Meal Header Images** - The large banner image at the top of the meal detail page fails to load. Currently showing a broken image icon where the meal image should appear.
- The "Customize Meal" button is present but its functionality isn't clear without clicking through
- Nutrition information section header is present but the actual detailed nutrition values appear to be missing

## Navigation
- Users can navigate back to the meal plan from the meal detail page via the "Back to Meal Plan" link
- The meal plan is accessible from the primary navigation menu

## Overall Assessment

The meal planning functionality provides a good foundation with comprehensive meal information, but has several issues that impact the user experience:

1. **Critical Issue:** Missing meal images (both header images and some thumbnails)
2. **Major Issue:** Limited meal plan customization options
3. **Minor Issue:** Incomplete nutrition information

The meal detail pages themselves are content-rich with information about prep time, ingredients, instructions, and menopause-specific benefits, which aligns well with the app's purpose of providing menopause-specific nutrition guidance.
