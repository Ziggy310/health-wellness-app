- Relief techniques categorized by symptom type: Physical, Emotional, Cognitive, and Sleep Relief
- Multiple relief technique cards with images, titles, duration, and related symptoms

### Interactive Elements

### Issues Identified

#### Critical Issues
1. **Non-Functional Technique Cards**: Unable to click on relief technique cards to view detailed content
   - Priority: Critical
   - Impact: Users cannot access actual relief techniques, which is the core functionality of the page

#### User Experience Issues
1. **Incomplete Guidance**: While techniques are categorized well, there's no clear user guidance on how to start or use these techniques
   - Priority: Major
   - Impact: Users may not understand how to properly engage with the content

2. **Limited Personalization**: The "Recommended for You" section doesn't appear to show truly personalized content
   - Priority: Minor
   - Impact: Reduced effectiveness of personalization feature

## Recommendations
1. Fix the interactive functionality of relief technique cards to ensure users can click and view detailed content
2. Add clearer instructions or a "How to use this page" section
3. Enhance the personalization algorithm to better match recommended techniques to user-reported symptoms
4. Add filter or search functionality to help users more quickly find relevant techniques
5. Consider adding progress tracking for techniques users have tried

## Next Steps
Will continue testing the Symptoms and Community sections to verify their interactive elements and functionality.
