# Meal Image Solution Plan

1. Fix immediate issues:
   - Correct JSON structure and location
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add fallback placeholder images
   
2. Develop meal image API integration:
   - Research available food image APIs
   - Design adapter pattern for API integration
   - Implement caching mechanism for performance

3. Create comprehensive fallback strategy:
   - Default images by meal category
   - Generic placeholders as last resort
   - Visual feedback for failed image loads

4. Implement standardized meal-image mapping:
   - Create consistent naming convention
   - Build automated mapping tools
   - Document pattern for future meal additions
