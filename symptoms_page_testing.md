# Symptoms Page Testing Results

## Overview
I accessed the Symptoms page at https://meno-plus-0rqum-exn6ad-a69f4f.mgx.dev/symptoms to test the symptom tracking functionality, which is a core interactive feature of the Meno+ application.

## Observations

### UI Elements Present
- Navigation menu with links to all main sections
- "Symptom Tracker" page header with descriptive subtitle
- Filter by Date section with date range pickers and quick filter buttons (Last 7 Days, Last 14 Days, etc.)
- "Log a New Symptom" section with:
  - Common symptom quick selection buttons (Hot Flashes, Night Sweats, Insomnia, etc.)
  - Symptom categories (Physical, Emotional, Cognitive, Sleep)
  - Form fields for Symptom Name, Category dropdown, Date, Severity slider, and Notes
  - "Log Symptom" button
- "Symptom History" section (currently showing "No symptoms recorded in this date range")

### Interactive Elements
- Date range pickers for filtering symptoms
- Quick filter buttons for common date ranges
- Common symptoms selection buttons
- Symptom logging form with text inputs, dropdown, date picker, and severity slider
- "Log Symptom" submission button

### Functional Testing
1. **Common Symptom Selection**: Successfully clicked on "Hot Flashes" button, which populated the Symptom Name field
2. **Text Input**: Successfully entered text in the Symptom Name field
3. **Category Dropdown**: Attempted to select from dropdown but encountered issues interacting with the dropdown menu
4. **Date Picker**: Present but unable to test interaction
5. **Severity Slider**: Slider shows default value of 3 (Moderate) but unable to interact with it
6. **Log Symptom Button**: Present but unable to test submission

### Issues Identified

#### Critical Issues
1. **Symptom Form Interactivity**: Most interactive elements in the symptom logging form are not properly functional
   - Priority: Critical
   - Impact: Users cannot complete the core functionality of tracking symptoms
   - Details: Unable to interact with dropdown menus, date pickers, and the severity slider

2. **No Symptom History**: The system shows "No symptoms recorded" but provides no way to successfully log symptoms
   - Priority: Critical
   - Impact: Core tracking functionality is broken

#### User Experience Issues
1. **Form Validation**: No clear validation or feedback when attempting to use the form
   - Priority: Major
   - Impact: Users don't know if their actions are being registered or processed

2. **Limited Guidance**: While the UI is visually appealing, there's limited instruction on how to effectively use the symptom tracker
   - Priority: Minor
   - Impact: New users may not understand how to get the most value from symptom tracking

## Recommendations
1. Fix interactive elements in the symptom logging form to ensure proper functionality
2. Add form validation and user feedback for form submissions
3. Include a sample or demo of symptom history to show users what to expect after logging symptoms
4. Add a tutorial or guide for first-time users of the symptom tracker
5. Consider adding data visualization for tracked symptoms over time to increase user engagement

## Next Steps
Will continue testing the Community and Resources sections to verify their interactive elements and functionality.
